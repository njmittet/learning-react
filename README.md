Notes and code written while learning React and Redux.

Serve the example files (in `.public/`) by executing `npx light-server -s public -p 8080  -w "public/**"` from the command line.

## Notes
[React and Redux](notes/ReactRedux.md) code examples created while learning from sources like [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

[Modern Javascript](notes/ModernJavaScript.md) code examples created while learning from [Introduction to ES6+](https://scrimba.com/g/gintrotoes6) and [Learn modern JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/g/ges6).
