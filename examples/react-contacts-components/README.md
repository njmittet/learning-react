# react-contacts-components

A React contact list application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and with general functionality extracted to sub-components.

The `package.json` provides the following scripts (listed in the order they normally would use them):

1. `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
2. `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
3. `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
4. `npm run eject`: If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Note that `npm install` must be runned before executing the above command.
