# react

This folder contain an example of using React without JSX or any build too.

The `package.json` provides the following scripts (listed in the order they normally would use them):

* `npm start`:  
  Starts [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) which serves the index.html file and the index.js file from the `./public` folder.

Note that `npm install` must be runned before executing the above command.

The example code is mostly an implementation of the code found on [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html).
